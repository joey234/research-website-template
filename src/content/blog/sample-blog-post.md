# Gatekeeping practices in Academia and Industry

If you work in academia or a research-focused position, you would likely find those things annoying.

1. **The BibTeX Formatting Saga**: No, I'm not talking about using the right format for a specific conference/journal. For some reasons, people are really obssessed with using the 'official' bib format.

Yes those things show an attention to details, but won't give the authors any more credit.

2. **The "Expression of Interest"**: Oh so you want to apply for some thing? You need to apply first in order to be able to apply later! Apply-ception.

3. **Big Tech Recruitment**: A typical big tech interview would go over 5 rounds at the minimum I believe.
